## Stat 436 Final Project

### Authors: John Quam, Connor Weida, Camryn Tautges, Austin Cohen

Welcome to our final project for Stat 436. Here we analyze US trade data with different countries over the time period from 1995 to 2020, and create several visualizations to help identify interesting trends and information. You can check out our visualizations [here](https://jquam15.shinyapps.io/436_Final_Project/)! Please give the app a couple seconds to load as it has to load a lot of data.

We got US import and export data with different countries for the above time period from the [Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/usa/show/all/2018.2019.2020/). We downloaded this data into the files **imports.csv** and **exports.csv**.

The file **process_data.ipynb** performs the data processing steps necessary to obtain the final dataset we used called **ustrade.csv**.
