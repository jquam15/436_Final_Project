## Stat 436 Final Project

Welcome to our final project for Stat 436. Here we analyze US trade data with different countries over the time period from 1995 to 2020, and create several visualizations to help identify interesting trends and information. We used data from the [Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/usa/show/all/2018.2019.2020/) to download import and export data separately to the files **imports.csv** and **exports.csv**.
